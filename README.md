# Classification-Techniques
This project focuses on applying classification techniques to a dataset to predict target labels using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset is prepared and analyzed using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Multiple classification algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, are implemented using Scikit-learn. The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations are created using Matplotlib to compare the performance of different models and to gain insights into their effectiveness. This project highlights the practical application of classification techniques in data analysis and predictive modeling.
